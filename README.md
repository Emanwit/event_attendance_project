**Predicting Campus Event Attendance Using Machine Learning
Overview
**
This project uses machine learning to predict attendance for campus events based on event details such as event type, promotion method, timing, weather, free food, and giveaways. The goal is to help student leaders and organizers plan events more efficiently by reducing guesswork around budgeting, space selection, and food planning. 

**Dataset**

500 simulated campus events modeled after real university activities

Features include event type, category, host organization, promotion method, date and time, weather, and incentives

Target variable: actual event attendance


**Models Used**

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Neural Network

Models were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R², with Random Forest achieving the best performance (R² = 0.659).
